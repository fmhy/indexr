## indexr

This project aims to:

- create a unified toolchain for parsing and outputting markdown, extended with
  special syntax to amplify experiences like on our site.
- store every link/item/info on the wiki periodically with their properties.
- store dead/removed sites with their reasoning from discord. (will need work on
  https://github.com/fmhy/turmoil, pending Rust rewrite)
- show a frontend for all dead/removed links
- hook up to typesense for site search and bot search.
